<p style="font-size:100px;">🌱</p> My Front-End Web Development Journey
Hi! I'm Abdullah Al Junayed, a newbie front-end web developer, just starting to learn how to build websites. This repository is a collection of the small projects I’ve been working on as I practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🛠️ What I’m Learning <br>
HTML – Building the structure of web pages
CSS – Styling and layouts
JavaScript – Adding basic interactivity (still learning!)

💻 My Projects (Work in Progress)<br>
Since I’m just starting out, my projects might be simple, but I’m excited to improve over time. Here are a few things I’m working on:

Basic Web Page<br>
A simple page with headings, paragraphs, and links.
Styled Page with CSS
Trying out different colors, fonts, and basic layouts using CSS.
JavaScript Button
A button that shows an alert when clicked (my first JavaScript project!).

🎯 Goals
Learn how to make my websites responsive so they look good on all devices.
Improve my JavaScript skills to add more functionality.
Start using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Thanks for checking out my repository! Any feedback or tips would be much appreciated as I continue learning.
