<h1>🌱 My Front-End Web Development Journey</h1>
Hi! I'm Abdullah Al Junayed, a newbie front-end web developer, just starting to learn how to build websites. This repository is a collection of the small projects I’ve been working on as I practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h1>🛠️ What I’m Learning</h1>
<li>HTML – Building the structure of web pages</li>
<li>CSS – Styling and layouts</li>
<li>JavaScript – Adding basic interactivity (still learning!)</li>

<h1>💻 My Projects (Work in Progress)</h1>
Since I’m just starting out, my projects might be simple, but I’m excited to improve over time. Here are a few things I’m working on:

<ol>Basic Web Page</ol>
<ul>A simple page with headings, paragraphs, and links.</ul>

2.Styled Page with CSS
<ul>Trying out different colors, fonts, and basic layouts using CSS.</ul>
3.JavaScript Button
<ul>>A button that shows an alert when clicked (my first JavaScript project!).</ul
<h1>🎯 Goals</h1>
<ul>Learn how to make my websites responsive so they look good on all devices.</ul>
<ul>Improve my JavaScript skills to add more functionality.</ul>
<ul>Start using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.</ul>

<h2>Thanks for checking out my repository! Any feedback or tips would be much appreciated as I continue learning.</h2>
